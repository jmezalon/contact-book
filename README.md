# Contact-book
This app is to imitate how a basic phone book would work. Users should be able to view their existing contact, favorite a contact, delete a contact and add a new contact. I am using fetch request to my database to persist the changes. This is a ideal practice to show case my understanding of basic CRUD events. I built this project in 3 days.

# Technologies
I am using react for the front-end. I have db.json file where I have some dummie contacts already set up.

# MVP
My mvp is to allow the user to see their contact. 
    Favorite their contacts, and delete a contact. 
    I also want the user to be able to sort through their contacts, by last name or first name alphabetically

# Stretch goals
I would like the user to be able to do more than just favorite their contacts. I want them to be able to change the names, numbers, email, and pictures. I want to add the dashes for the user if they add a phone number without them. Do a list and grid view.
