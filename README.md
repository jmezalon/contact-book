# Contact-book
this app is to imitate how a basic phone book would work. Users should be able to view their existing contact, favorite a contact, delete a contact and add a new contact. I am also using fetch request to my database to persist the changes. This is a ideal practice to show case my understanding of basic CRUD events.

# Technologies
I am using react for the front-end. I have db.json file where I have some dummie contacts already set up.

# mvp
My mvp is to allow the user to see their contact. Favorite their contacts, and delete a contact.

# Stretch goals
I would like the user to be able to do more than just favorite their contacts. I want them to be able to change the names, numbers, email, and pictures.
